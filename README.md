# End-to-End QA Chatbot

This repository provides an end-to-end QA (Question-Answering) Chatbot that integrates multiple state-of-the-art technologies. The chatbot can scrape websites using BeautifulSoup (bs4), retrieve relevant documents via vector retrieval, and maintain conversation history to provide context-aware responses. It leverages advanced tools and models including **Groq**, **Huggingface**, **OpenAI**, and **Ollama models**, and uses prompt templates to structure queries.

## Overview

The project demonstrates how to:

- Build a conversational chatbot that interacts with websites and answers questions contextually.
- Scrape websites using **BeautifulSoup (bs4)**.
- Retrieve context-relevant documents using **vector retrieval** techniques.
- Maintain conversation history to provide context-aware responses.
- Use prompt templates for effective query structuring.
- Integrate multiple models including **Groq**, **Huggingface**, **OpenAI**, and **Ollama models**.

## Features
